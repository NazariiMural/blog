summary: Error handling is the process of handling the possibility of failure. JavaScript provides an error-handling mechanism to catch runtime errors using try-catch-finally block.

### What is the output of this code?

```javascript
try {
    setTimeout(() => {
        // ‚ùå Error won't be caught inside the catch block
        throw new Error("Houston, we have a problem!");
    }, 0);
} catch (error) {
    console.error("Error caught inside try/catch block/n:", error);
}


Error: Houston, we have a problem!
    at Timeout._onTimeout (~/async_error_handling/index.js:11:15)
    at listOnTimeout (node:internal/timers:573:17)
    at process.processTimers (node:internal/timers:514:7)
```

#### So why do you think try/catch block didn't catch an Error?
Exactly, because at the moment when the error was `thrown` **Stack** was already empty.<br />
When the `try catch` block is executed, there is no error.<br />
When the _error_ is `thrown`, there is no `try catch`.<br />
So how we can fix that? There are dozens of ways to solve this, but the most accurate one is to handle error in the place where it can actually be thrown.<br />

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
    try {
        // Imagine that something went terribly wrong here...
        // ‚úÖ Error will be caught inside catch block
        throw new Error("Houston, we have a problem!");

        // ...
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("An Error caught inside try/catch block:\n", error);
    }
}, 0);


    An Error caught inside try/catch block:
    Error: Houston, we have a problem!
        at Timeout.timeoutCallback [as _onTimeout] (~/async_error_handling/index.js:32:15)
        at listOnTimeout (node:internal/timers:573:17)
        at process.processTimers (node:internal/timers:514:7)

```

### `finally`
try...catch construct may have one more code clause: `finally`.<br />
If it exists, it runs in all cases:
    - after `try`, if there were no errors;
    - after `catch`, if there were errors;

The extended syntax looks like this:

```javascript
try {
  // ... try to execute the code ...
} catch (err) {
  // ... handle errors ...
} finally {
  // ... execute always ...
}
```

### Rethrowing
Rethrowing is a very important pattern of error handling.
A catch block usually expects and knows how to handle the particular error type, so it should rethrow errors it doesn‚Äôt know.

```javascript
enum ProductsErrorReason {
    LOW_CURRENCY = 1,
    // ....
}

class GeneralError extends Error {
    // send `data` to the log_service
    // ...
    log() {}
}

// ProductsError class created specifically to generate the error
// related to the product functionality
class ProductsError extends GeneralError {
    public type: string = "ProductsErrorType";
    private reason: ProductsErrorReason;
    // ...
    constructor(reason: ProductsErrorReason) {
        super();
        this.reason = reason;
    }
    // Implement specific functionality to handle ProductsError here...
}

const fetchProducts = async () => {
    // Could be an Error that isn't related to the function...
    try {
        // Fetch `products` from service, if something is wrong with products throw an error that related to the Products
        if (some_problem_with_products) {
            throw new ProductsError(ProductsErrorReason.LOW_CURRENCY);
        }
        // Imagine everything is OK with Products, but there could unknown error:
        //     - EventBus error, DB error, etc.
        // ....
    } catch (error) {
        // This catch block must handle only errors that are related to the functionality inside `try` block.
        // So it's always a good practice to check if the error is actually `yours`
        if (error instanceof ProductsError) {
            // Handle product error
            // ...
        }
        // If this error is unknown to this block of code throw it further.
        // And HOPE that someone will catch it üôÇ
        throw error;
    }
};
```
