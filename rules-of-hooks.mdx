summary: Why can't we use hooks conditionally? How do hooks work? Where is data stored? What is React Fiber? We are gonna try to answer all those questions together.

## Prerequisites 
In this short post about react hooks we are going to start with **Conclusion** ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

### Conclusion
1. **What are hooks?**<br />
    React hooks allow the usage of different React features inside functional components.
2. **Where is components data stored?**<br />
    All components data (`next prev states`, `props`...) are stored inside `FiberNode` instance.
3. **Why can't we use hooks conditionally?**<br />
    React stores hooks execution **order** inside similar to the Linked List Data Structure where one hook has a `pointer` to the `next` one.
    And this _data structure_ lives inside `Fiber tree` thought re-renders.<br />
    If the order of the hook execution is different between re-renders - **nodes inside `FiberNode` structure lose a pointer and point to a totally different thing and the whole structure simply can't work properly anymore.**

### What are hooks?
Hooks let you use different React features from your functional components, you can use:

- built-in hooks: `use`, `useReducer`, `useRef`, `useContext`...
- or you can build your own

### Where is data stored?
**Shortly:** _All components data (next, prev `states`, `props`...) are stored inside FiberNode._<br />

**Verbosely:**<br />
When we are building our React app, we are using **components**. Components are independent and reusable bits of code.
Based on those components React is going to build **virtual tree** - this tree is called the `fiber tree`.<br />

**Fiber Tree** keeps track of all information about `components` through re-render. 
Fiber Tree consists of nodes called - `FiberNode`.

**FiberNode** keeps track of all information about single react component: `state`, `props`, `owner`, and so on.
For example, we are using several `useState` hooks inside our component. When React computes Fiber Tree, 
React will write the default values of each individual `useState` hook and the order they're called **inside** `FiberNode`.<br />
Let's take a look at the small component example:

```jsx harmony
function App() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState<number>(0);
    const [name, setName] = useState<string>("John");

    return (
        <div className="card">
            <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => ++c)}>
                Count is {count}
            </button>
            <hr />
            <input value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```
In this example we have two pieces of state with default values: `count="0"` and `name="John"`;
Now take a look at how this state is going to be represented inside `FiberNode`
![Hooks](/static/images/hooks/hooks_1.png)
As you can see order of the hooks execution is strictly the same as it is in our component above, 
and one useState has a pointer to another one `FiberNode -> memoizedState -> next ->`. You may already guess where I'm going with it. 

So what happens after re-render? React is going to execute the app and pass the values that were `kept in memory` inside the `FiberNode`. <br />
So the first state `const [count, setCount] = useState<number>(0);` is going to be reading - into the **first element** of the linked list, and the second state `const [name, setName] = useState<string>("John");` is going to be reading - into the **second element** of the linked list (into the property `.next` of the first one). <br />
What if at the next render, you add or remove a hook, in that case, you change the order of the execution of the hook and one or more of your hooks are going to point to the **irrelevant** data, to the data that is not related to that hook.

### Why can't we use hooks conditionally?
<div className="flex justify-center plain_image">
    ![Why](/static/images/hooks/why.gif)
</div>
React has to keep track of stuff for you in between renders.<br />
Hooks rely on the **order** in which they're called. **They are all interdependent in their linked lists**. This is why you can't use them conditionally.

### What does React Fiber solve?
When the re-render happens, React knows which elements should be rendered, and which information should be updated in the DOM, etc.<br />
- Fiber can mark `state updates` in React with different levels of **priority**.<br />
- Fiber breaks the computation of the component tree into nodes, or `'units' of work` that it can commit at any time.<br />
- Fiber allows React to: **pause, resume, or restart computation for various components**.

### Rules of hooks
ðŸ”´ Do not call Hooks inside conditions or loops.<br />
ðŸ”´ Do not call Hooks after a conditional `return` statement.<br />
ðŸ”´ Do not call Hooks in event handlers.<br />
