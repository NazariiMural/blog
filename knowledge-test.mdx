### Why does this post exist?
This post was created to collect cool topics of the JS land, that sometimes may be crucial to remember, and sometimes are just funny to know about.
Briefly, this post it's a collection of the 'JS moments' - that we as developers don't see very often, but understanding them may be very helpful.    
Most of the topics gonna be something like: _guess the output_ or _why it doesn't work_.

### EventLoop execution order: `promises`, `queueMicrotask`.
<p className="m-0">Guess the output order.</p>
```javascript
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(1));

queueMicrotask(() => console.log(2));

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(3);
}, 0);

console.log(4);

new Promise(() => {
    console.log(5);
});

(async () => console.log(6))();
```

    <summary>**Answer**</summary>

<p className="mx-0 my-1 font-bold">4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3</p>
<p className="mx-0 my-0">Explanation:</p>
1. `console.log(4);` - that is a synchronous function call.
2. Body of the `new Promise()` always runs synchronously.
3. Immediately invoked function expression **IIFE**:
    <Callout size="xs">
        <p className="p-0 m-0 tracking-tight leading-tight">All code after `await` statement is considered as `microtask`, until that code is considered as **synchronous** code.</p>
    </Callout>

    ```javascript
    (async () => console.log(1))();
    new Promise(() => console.log(2));
    console.log(3);
    // 1, 2, 3
    ```
4. Since the call stack is empty now, EventLoop can process queues: microtask and after macrotask. 
And first item in microtask queue is resolved promise: `then(() => console.log(1)`.
5. Next `queueMicrotask(() => console.log(2));` - based on the name it's obvious from what queue this callback came to call stack.
6. Since callstack is empty and nothing else in microtask queue, EventLoop will process macrotask queue: `setTimeout(() => console.log(3), 0);`

### Which of the following are not considered microtask in JavaScript's EventLoop?
a. `Script` loading<br />
b. `setTimeout` callback<br />
c. `mousemove` event<br />
d. `requestAnimationFrame` callback<br />
e. UI rendering<br />
f. `then` callback<br />
g. `new Promise` execution function<br />
h. `fetch` calls<br />

<details>
    <summary>**Answer**</summary>
<p className="mx-0 my-1">All of them except `then` callback. Only `then` callback will be added to the `microtask` queue.</p>
<Divider />
</details>

### EventLoop execution order: `promises`, `async/await`.
<p className="m-0">What value will be last one?</p>
```javascript showLineNumbers
async function asyncFunction() {
    console.log(1);
    new Promise(() => console.log(2));
    await new Promise((res) => {
        setTimeout(() => console.log(3), 0);
        res();
    });
}

new Promise((res) => {
    console.log(4);
    (async () => {
        console.log(5);
        await asyncFunction()
        console.log(6);
    })();
    res();
}).then(() => console.log(7));

console.log(8);
```

<p className="mx-0 my-1 font-bold">4, 5, 1, 2, 8, 6, 7, 3</p>
<p className="mx-0 my-1">So, What exactly happened?</p>

1. `new Promise` pushed to the call stack.
2. First thing in its body is: `console.log(4);` pushed to the callstack, executed, and popped out.
3. After that we have IIFE `async () => `:
    - this body runs synchronously till the `await` moment. `console.log(5);` -> to stack, executed, popped.
4. `asyncFunction` - pushed to stack.
5. `console.log(1);` - to stack, executed, popped.
6. `new Promise(() => console.log(2));` - to stack, executed, popped.
7. `await new Promise((res)`- pushed to stack.
    - `setTimeout(() => console.log(3), 0)` - to stack, to the web timer API, and on the NextTick of EventLoop to the **macrotask queue**.
8. Body of `asyncFunction` executed, pushed to its queues - we are still **awaiting** and `asyncFunction` itself pushed to the **microtask queue** and EventLoop will execute, rest of the code.
9. `res();` pushed to the stack, `await new Promise` popped out from the stack.
10. `then(() => console.log(7));` - to stack and its callback `console.log(7)` to the **microtask queue**.
11. `console.log(8);` - to stack, executed, popped.
12. Now callstack is empty: EventLoop will start to pop out from queues.
13. `asyncFunction` from the **microtask queue** - implicit `return undefined`.
14. Since `asyncFunction` executed completely, **rest** of `(async () => {` can be pushed to **microtask queue** - `console.log(6);` to the microtask queue.
15.  `console.log(7)` - to stack, executed, popped.
16. Rest of the `(async () => {` to the stack -> `console.log(6);` - to stack, executed, popped.
17. `() => console.log(3)` - to stack, executed, popped.

### EventLoop execution order: `async`, `Promise.all`.
<p className="m-0">What value will be first one?</p>
```javascript showLineNumbers
(async () => {
    const asyncFunc = async () => "asyncFunc";

    const promise = new Promise(() => {
        console.log("promise");
    }).then(() => console.log("then"));

    console.log("asyncBody");

    queueMicrotask(() => {
        console.log("queueMicrotask");
    });

    const results = await Promise.all([asyncFunc(), promise]);

    return results;
})();

console.log("script");
```
<details>
    <summary>**Answer**</summary>
<p className="mx-0 my-1 font-bold">`promise`, `asyncBody`, `script`, `queueMicrotask`</p>
<p className="mx-0 my-1">Why, there is no `then` from the line 6? 
Because `new Promise` defined on line 4, was never resolved - it's remained in a `pending` state.</p>
<Callout size="xs">
<p className="m-0">Promise three states:</p>
<ul className="m-0">
    <li className="m-0">`pending` initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.</li>
    <li className="m-0">`fulfilled` operation was completed successfully.</li>
    <li className="m-0">`rejected` operation failed.</li>
</ul>
</Callout>
</details>

### Scopes and Closures
<p className="m-0">There are three types of scopes in JavaScript: `Global`, `Block`, `Function`</p>
```javascript
const name = "John" ;        // Global Scope
{
    const name = "John";     // Block Scope
}
function foo() {
    const name = "John";     // Function Scope 
}
```
<p className="m-0">When one function is defined inside another - the inner function has access to the outer function's scope. 
JavaScript **closure** it's a combination of a function and references to its lexical environment. 
In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.</p>

<p className="m-0 font-bold">What is the output?</p>

```javascript showLineNumbers
function createCounter() {
    let global = 0;
    function incrementCounter() {
        const incremented = ++global;
        return incremented;
    }
    return { incrementCounter };
}

const counter = createCounter();

console.log(counter.incrementCounter());
console.log(counter.incrementCounter());
console.log(createCounter().incrementCounter());
```

<p className="m-0 font-bold">Are these objects are equal?</p>
```javascript showLineNumbers
function userFactory() {
    let user = { name: "", createAt: Date.now() };

    return (name) => {
        "use strict";
        user.name = name;
        user.createAt = Date.now();
        return user;
    };
}
const createUser = userFactory();
console.log(createUser("John") === createUser("NotJohn"));
```
<details>
    <summary>**Answer**</summary>
<p className="m-0 font-bold">Yes, it's the same object.</p>
<p className="m-0">`userFactory` function it's a buggy implementation of the factory pattern,
to fix the bug new object must be returned. But I think that is great example of the **closure in JavaScript**.</p>
<p className="m-0 mb-1">When we are comparing objects - we are comparing just `reference in memory`.</p>

### What is a Hoisting?
<p className="m-0">Spoiler alert: Word _Hoisting_ is a bit a magic word. JS Engine **does not** _move_ anything to the top of file while parsing it. 
So, there is no such thing as a _hoisting_...?</p>

    width={480}
    height={400}
/>
<p className="m-0 mt-1">There is a term called _hoisting_, but it doesn't mean that something changing its position, 
we will return to the hoisting definition a bit later in this post, but for now, let's consider the next example.</p>
<br />
<p className="m-0 font-bold">Which statements are correct?</p>
- a. Hoisting is a process of moving functions and variables to the top of the file
- b. Variables declared with the `let` and `const` are hoisted
- c. Variables declared with the `var` keyword are uninitialized
- d. Hoisting occurred during the execution phase
- e. `import` declarations are hoisted

    <summary>**Answer**</summary>
<p className="m-0 font-bold">`b` and `e`</p>
<Divider />
</details>

<p className="m-0 mt-2">When the JS engine starts to work with any `.js` files it makes an environment called the **Execution Context** and it has two phases:</p>
1. Creation phase
2. Execution phase

<p className="m-0 font-bold">During the **creation phase** JS engine:</p>
- Creates a global object: `window/global`
- Sets up memory for storing `variables` and `functions`.
- Stores the variables with the `var` keyword with default value `undefined` and function declaration name with the function reference.

<p className="m-0 font-bold">During the **execution phase**:</p>
- JavaScript engine executes the code line by line. This includes evaluating and executing statements.

<h4 className="m-0 font-bold">Hoisting examples</h4>

```javascript
const framework = "Next.js";
let renderingPattern = "SSR";
var bestProgrammingLanguage = "HTML😁";
```
<p className="m-0">During the **creation phase**, all those variables except `var bestProgrammingLanguage` gonna be `Uninitialized` 
and only variables with `var` keyword will have an initial value as `undefined`, during the **execution phase**, all variables gonna be assigned to corresponding values.</p>

<p className="m-0 mt-2">Please take a look at the one more example below:</p>
```javascript
var counter = 1;

function resetCounter() {
    console.log(counter);   // undefined
    var counter = 0;
    console.log(counter);   // 0
};

resetCounter();
```
<p className="m-0">One more example with error:</p>
```javascript
let counter = 1;

function resetCounter() {
    console.log(counter);
    const counter = 0;
    console.log(counter);
};

resetCounter();
```
<p className="m-0">As you may guess above code gonna throws an error `Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'counter' before initialization`.</p>
<p className="m-0">All JS code runs line by line during the execution phase and when we are trying to log `console.log(counter);` 
JS engine **throws** an error - that counter isn't initialized - this means that `counter` variable is so-called _hoisted_ - 
it already exists in our **Function lexical environment**, otherwise error would be totally different. Check image below:</p>

    className="m-0 h-40 sm:h-auto mt-4 mx-auto"
    width={443}
    height={204}
/>
<p className="m-0 mt-4">So shortly - **Hoisting** it's a process of setting the default value to the corresponding declaration during the creation phase.</p>


### What is a `this` keyword?

<Image

    alt="this_unbelievable"
    src="/static/images/improve-js-knowledge/this_unbelievable.webp"
    className="m-0 w-full h-56 sm:w-3/5 sm:h-72 mb-4 mx-auto"
    width={370}
    height={290}
/>

The value of `this` keyword depends on where we are using it.<br />
**Global context** - when `this` is used in a global context the value of `this` gonna be a global object.<br />
**Function context** - when `this` is used in function context the value of `this` gonna be the `object` on which the function is **invoked**.<br />
**Arrow function** -  when `this` is used in arrow function the value of `this` gonna be determined by the lexical environment in which the arrow function is defined.<br />
**Classes** - when `this` is used in classes the value of `this` gonna be an instance of that class.<br />
**Strict mode** - when `this` is pointing to a global object in strict mode the value of `this` gonna be `undefined`.<br />

<h4 className="m-0 font-bold">`this` examples</h4>
<p className="my-3">Would you be able to answer all of these questions correctly?</p>

```js:#0_this.js showLineNumbers
function printContext() {
    console.log(this);
}

const thatObj = {
    printContext,
    printContext_1() {
        return printContext();
    },
    printContext_2() {
        return thatObj.printContext();
    },
};

thatObj.printContext();
thatObj.printContext_1();
thatObj.printContext_2();
```

<details className="mb-4">
    <summary>**Answer**</summary>
<p className="m-0 font-bold">`thatObj`, `global`, `thatObj`</p>

- `thatObj.printContext` - printContext function was assigned to the printContext props of `thatObj`, and we called body of this function in the context of the `thatObj`.
- `thatObj.printContext_1` - is just the return result of `printContext` function, so nothing related to `thatObj`.
- `thatObj.printContext_2` - is the same as `this.printContext()`.

```js:#1_this.js showLineNumbers
const thatObj_1 = {
    foo() {
        console.log(this);
    },
    bar: () => {
        console.log(this);
    },
};

const thatObj_2 = {
    foo: thatObj_1.foo,
    bar: () => thatObj_1.bar(),
    baz() {
        thatObj_1.foo();
    },
    bam() {
        thatObj_1.foo.call(this);
    },
    bah() {
        const nestedF = () => {
            console.log(this);
        };
        nestedF();
    },
};

thatObj_2.foo();
thatObj_2.bar();
thatObj_2.baz();
thatObj_2.bam();
thatObj_2.bah();
```
<details className="mb-4">
    <summary>**Answer**</summary>
<p className="m-0 font-bold">`thatObj_2`, `global`, `thatObj_1`, `thatObj_2`, `thatObj_2`</p>

- `thatObj_2.bam` - we called `foo` method with `this` of `thatObj_2`. In case of object methods, it doesn't matter where object method is defined - it only matters how it's **invoked**.
- `thatObj_2.bah` - in this case `this` will be pointing to the parent scope, which is `thatObj_2`.
<Divider />
</details>
 
```js:#2_this.js showLineNumbers
const thatObj = {
    printContext() {
        console.log(this);
    },
    printContext_1() {
        function nestedF() {
            console.log(this);
        };
        nestedF.apply(this);
    },
};

const { printContext, printContext_1 } = thatObj;

printContext();
printContext_1();
thatObj.printContext();
thatObj.printContext_1();
```

<details>
    <summary>**Answer**</summary>
<p className="m-0 font-bold">`global`, `global`, `thatObj`, `thatObj`</p>

- `printContext()` and `printContext_1()` - when those methods were destructured, the value of `this` was pointed to the context in which these methods were called, 
in this case, global object.

<p className="my-3">Is it possible to iterate through an object using `Array.forEach` method?</p>
<p className="m-0 font-bold">Yes! We can just `call` it😊.</p>

```javascript showLineNumbers
const arrayLike = {
  length: 3,
  0: 2,
  1: 3,
  2: 4,
  3: 5, // ignored by forEach() since length is 3
};

Array.prototype.forEach.call(arrayLike, (x) => console.log(x)); // 2, 3, 4
```
