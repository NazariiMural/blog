## React keys
What is **"key"** prop and what is the benefit of using it in arrays of elements?
- A key is a special attribute you should include when mapping over arrays to render data.
- Key prop helps React **identify** which items have changed, are added, or are removed.
- Keys should be **unique** among its siblings. Most often we use ID from our data as key.
- Using ~indexes~ for keys is not recommended if the order of items may **change**. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state.

### Rules of keys
- Keys must be **unique** among siblings. However, it’s okay to use the same keys for JSX nodes in different arrays.
- Keys should not **change** or be generated while rendering (on the fly) e.g. with `key={Math.random()}` or array `indexes`. This will cause keys to never match up between renders, leading to all your components and DOM being recreated **every** time.
  Not only is this slow, but it will also lose any user input inside the list items. Instead, use a stable ID based on the data.

Take a close look at the bellow example where we have React component called `ListWithoutKeys` that renders **dynamic list** without `stable key`.
Instead of stable id, we are using array `index` prop.

```JSX
import { useState, createElement } from "react";

const dataList = [
    { type: "li", props: { className: "list_item" }, children: "Item #0" },
    // ...
];

const ListWithoutKeys = () => {
    const [list, setList] = useState(dataList);

    const handleElementUnshift = () =>
        setList((prevList) => [
            { ...prevList[0], children: `Item #${prevList.length}` },
            ...prevList,
        ]);

    return (
        <div className="card">
            <ul>
                {list.map((el, index) =>
                    // using index as a `key`
                    createElement(el.type, { ...el.props, key: index }, el.children)
                )}
            </ul>
            <button onClick={handleElementUnshift}>Add new element to the top</button>
        </div>
    );
};
```
<div className="w-full plain_image">
    ![Indexes](/static/images/keys/2.gif)
</div>
As you may see when we are clicking on `Add` button, whole list gets re-rendered, but we added only **one** item. This happened because there are no stable keys, 
on initial render element with the title `"Item #0"` has `0` value as `key`. And after adding new element to the `list`, 
React re-render component and element with the title `"Item #0"` now has `1` value as `key`, and React can't identify what exactly changed and re-renders whole list. 
To fix this, just add stable `key` prop that doesn't changes while rendering.


```JSX
import { useState, createElement } from "react";

// idHub is used only for demonstration
const dataList = [
    { type: "li", props: { className: "list_item", key: idHub[0] }, children: "Item #0" },
    // ...
];

const ListWithKeys = () => {
    const [list, setList] = useState(dataList);

    const handleElementUnshift = () =>
        setList((prevList) => [
            {
                ...prevList[0],
                props: { ...prevList[0].props, key: idHub[prevList.length] },
                children: `Item #${prevList.length}`,
            },
            ...prevList,
        ]);

    return (
        <div className="card">
            <ul>{list.map((el) => createElement(el.type, el.props, el.children))}</ul>
            <button onClick={handleElementUnshift}>Add new element to the top</button>
        </div>
    );
};
```
<div className="w-full plain_image">

</div>

As you may see **only newly added element re-rendered**, React is smart enough to figure out what changed.

### Why does React need keys?
Imagine that files on your desktop didn’t have names.
Instead, you’d refer to them by their order — the first file, the second file, and so on.
You could get used to it, but once you delete a file, it would get confusing.
The second file would become the first file, the third file would be the second file, and so on.

Keys helps React uniquely identify an item between its siblings.
When the position of the element changes, `key` lets React identify what happen with this item between re-rendering.

#### Here is a small example what could happen when using list without `key` property in React.
1. Write something inside input
2. Try to remove remove first input.<br /> - See what happen? Doesn't matter which input you are trying to remove. From `view` always gonna be removed last one in the list.
3. Add `key={item.id}` property to the list and try again. See? Works just fine.<br />
