### Node.js
Node.js is an event-based platform. This means that everything that happens in Node is the reaction to an event.<br />
The below diagram denotes a simplified version of Node.js architecture.

### libuv
libuv is an open-source library written in C.
libuv can delegate I/O operations to the OS Kernel, which of course can be multi-threaded.
Because of that, Node.js can perform I/O operations in a non-blocking way.
When an I/O operation is ended by the OS, it notifies the Event Loop to add an appropriate callback to the queue and Node.js finally executes it.
Operating systems provide multi-threaded `interfaces` for many I/O tasks, but not for all that libuv needed.
Whenever possible, libuv will use those multi-threaded interfaces, but there are few tasks that require using of internal libuv's thread pool.

### libuv Thread pool
**Why?**
Unlike network I/O, when there are no platform-specific asynchronous interfaces for `blocking I/O operations` libuv must run those operations inside thread pool.
These are the Node.js module APIs that make use of this Worker Pool:
- File system operations
- DNS lookup
- Crypto: `crypto.pbkdf2()`, `crypto.scrypt()`, `crypto.randomBytes()`, `crypto.randomFill()`, `crypto.generateKeyPair()`
- Zlib: All zlib APIs

**Thread pool** default size is 4, but it can be changed at startup time by setting the `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` environment variable to any value (the absolute maximum is 1024).

### V8
V8 is Google’s open-source JavaScript engine, written in C++. V8 directly translates JavaScript code into efficient machine code using JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler instead of using an interpreter.

### Event Loop
The Event Loop lives inside libuv and it allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations, by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible.
The Event Loop will go through a `phase`, execute the callbacks related to that `phase`, and then move to the next one.<br />
Each `phase` has a callback queue. Depending on the task, it will send it to the corresponding queue.
Between each run of the **Event Loop**, Node.js checks if it is waiting for any asynchronous I/O or timers and shuts down cleanly if there are not any.

### Event Loop: Phases
`timers:` Executes callbacks scheduled by `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`.<br />
`pending callbacks:` Executes callbacks for some system operations e.g. TCP errors.<br />
`idle, prepare:` Only used internally in Libuv.<br />
`poll:` Event Loop Retrieve new I/O events, execute I/O related callbacks (almost all except for close callbacks, the ones scheduled by `timers`, and `setImmediate()`).<br />
`check:` Execute `setImmediate()` callbacks.<br />
`close callbacks:` Execute `close` callbacks, e.g. `socket.on('close', ...)`.<br />

### Event Loop: Phases: In Detail
Each phase is a queue, so callbacks are executed in FIFO order.
If Event loop in working inside some phase, it will execute callbacks until the current queue is **empty** or the maximum number of callbacks are reached. And only after that event loop will move to the next phase.
Event loop offload operation to the system kernel (most kernels are multi-threaded) `->` operation completes `->` kernel tells Node.js so that the appropriate callback may be added to the `poll` queue

#### timers

A timer specifies **approximate** number of milliseconds after which a provided callback may be executed - **not the exact time.**

#### poll queue
1. First when Event Loop is inside the poll queue it first checks if there are any **immediate callbacks**, if yes - then Event Loop proceeds to the `check phase`.
2. Poll queue is empty:
   - The poll phase waits for any pending I/O events to complete, then executes their callbacks immediately.
   - When the poll phase becomes idle and there is a callback that has been scheduled using `setImmediate()`, the Event Loop will enter the `check phase` instead of waiting for new I/O events.
3. Poll queue isn't empty:
   - Event Loop will execute each callback inside the queue - synchronously, until either the queue is empty, or the system-dependent hard limit is reached.

#### check
In this phase, callbacks scheduled using `setImmediate()` are executed - not the timer phase.

#### `setImmediate()`
The main advantage to using `setImmediate()` over `setTimeout()` is `setImmediate()` will always be executed before any timers if scheduled within an I/O cycle,
no matter of how many timers are present.

```javascript
/**
 * The order of this block depends on the system workload, which could be different for every execution
 */
setImmediate(() => console.log('Immediate'))
setTimeout(() => console.log('Timeout'))
```

</div>
```javascript
/**
 * In the below examples setImmediate always gonna be executed before setTimeout
 */

// Example #1
setTimeout(() => {
  // setTimeout inside I/O cycle always gonna be executed after setImmediate
  setTimeout(() => console.log('timeout #1'));
  // setImmediate inside callbacks always gonna be executed before setTimeout
  setImmediate(() => console.log('immediate #1'));
});

// Example #2
fs.readFile('./big.db', () => {
  setTimeout(() => console.log('timeout #2'));
  // Gonna be executed before setTimeout always!!!
  setImmediate(() => console.log('immediate #2'));
});
```

  ![setImmediate_setTimeout_2](/static/images/event_loop/setImmediate_setTimeout_2.png)
</div>

#### `process.nextTick()`
Every time the event loop takes a full trip, we call it a **tick**.
Callback that was passed to `process.nextTick()`, gonna be executed **right after** the current operation ends - regardless of the current phase of the Event Loop.
_Using `process.nextTick()` helps process a function asynchronously as soon as possible._

```javascript
setImmediate(() => console.log('Immediate'));
setTimeout(() => console.log('Timeout'));
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('Promise'));
process.nextTick(() => console.log('process.nextTick'));
```

</div>

### Microtask, Macrotask queues, and process.nextTick queue
What the differences between `setImmediate`, `setTimeout(cb, 0)`, `process.nextTick()`vs `Promise.then()`?<br />
1. Callback passed to the `process.nextTick()` will always be executed before `setTimeout` and `setImmediate`, because it gonna be executed **right after** the current operation ends - **in the current iteration** of the Event Loop.
2. Callback passed to the `setImmediate()` will be executed **in the next iteration** of the Event Loop.
3. Callback with a 0ms delay in `setTimeout()` is very similar to `setImmediate()`. The execution order will depend on different factors, but they will be both run in the **next iteration** of the Event Loop.

To what queues does each callback belong?

- A `Promise.then()` callback is added to promises **microtask** queue.
- A `process.nextTick` callback is added to **process.nextTick queue**.
- A `setTimeout`, callback is added to **timers** queue. 
- A `setImmediate`, callback is added to **check** queue.

**Order of execution:**<br />
Event loop executes tasks in next order: **microtask queue** `->` **process.nextTick queue** `->` **check queue**  `->` **timers queue**.

### Examples
```javascript
const run = () => {
    console.log("start");                                             // 1
    
    setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout"));                         // 6
    setImmediate(() => console.log("Immediate"));                     // 5 

    new Promise((resolve) => {
        resolve("Promise");
    }).then((text) => {
      process.nextTick(() => console.log("process.nextTick #0"));     // 4
      console.log(text);                                              // 2                                       
    });

    process.nextTick(() => console.log("process.nextTick #1"));       // 3
};
run();
// start, Promise, process.nextTick #1, process.nextTick #0, Immediate, Timeout
```
Work is gonna look like this:
1. event Loop will first call `console.log("start")`
2. adds cb from `setTimeout` to the timers queue
3. adds cb from `setImmediate` to the check queue
4. execute body of the `new Promise()` synchronously
5. adds cb from `new Promise` to the microtask queue
6. adds cb from `process.nextTick(#1);` to the process.nextTick queue
5. execute microtask queue `promiseCallback` - remember it has **highest** priority
6. adds cb from `process.nextTick(#0);` to the process.nextTick queue
7. since microtask queue is empty execute process.nextTick queue in FIFO order: `nextTickCallback(#1)`, `nextTickCallback(#0)`
8. execute check queue`immediateCallback`

Starting with node `v11`, `nextTick queue` callbacks and `microtasks` will run between each individual `setTimeout` and `setImmediate` callbacks, even if the timers queue or the check queue is not empty. Check the example below.
This was done to improve the performance of promise-related code as promises became more of a central part of the Node.js architecture for asynchronous operations.

```javascript
setImmediate(() => console.log('timeout1'));            // 1
setImmediate(() => {
    console.log('timeout2')                             // 2
    process.nextTick(() => console.log('next tick'))    // 3  
});
setImmediate(() => console.log('timeout3'));            // 4
setImmediate(() => console.log('timeout4'));            // 5

// timeout1, timeout2, next tick, timeout3, timeout4
```

Promises have their own special treatment. **Microtask queue** runs a lot more often than other queues even compared to the **nextTick queue**. Check the example below:

```javascript
process.nextTick(() => console.log(1));                 // 5
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(2));           // 1
Promise.resolve()
    .then(() => {
        console.log(3);                                 // 2
        process.nextTick(() => console.log(4));         // 6
        Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log(5));   // 3
    })
    .then(() => {
        console.log(6);                                 // 4
    });

// 2, 3, 5, 6, 1, 4
```
